Vinh's Workshop

The purpose of this whole project was to transfer as much data and business from discord server to one structured place that is accessable to anyone with interenet access. 
With that idea in mind, project is about 70% totally complete.

Frameworks and APIs used in making this project (subject to change):
- GSAP
- Currency conversion

Current objectives to complete:
- Add Merch store and all products set up
- Set up paymet process
- Set up legal aspects
- Make Contact form work (HTML and CSS already made)
- Allow orders for Helmets and Figurines
- Add occassional ads on the website (quite controversial as we all hate ads popping up but I will do my best to not make them as annoying as TRUST ME I RELATE)
- Pay for ads directing to the website
- Fix the On-page SEO
- Handle Off-page SEO
- ...
